1. Time Complexity of  Miller–Rabin Based Method

The algorithm computes the n-th prime by:
Checking all integers from 2 up to the n-th prime

Using the Miller–Rabin primality test as the detector

Breakdown
(a) Number of integers tested
 The n-th prime is approximately:
p_n ≈ n * log(n)

So we test about n log n numbers.

(b) Cost of one Miller–Rabin test
Let:
b = log(n) = number of bits of the numbers being tested

t = number of Miller–Rabin rounds (we use t = 10)

Each Miller–Rabin test takes approximately:
O(t * b^3)
because modular exponentiation is the dominant operation.

(c) Total time complexity
Total work = (numbers tested) × (work per MR test)
T(n) = O( (n log n) * t * (log n)^3 )

Simplified:
Final Complexity:  O( t * n * (log n)^4 )

This is polynomial time and very efficient.

2. Time Complexity of Willans’ Formula
Willans’ formula involves:
An outer summation that goes up to 2^n

An inner expression that contains factorials (j-1)!

The cost of evaluating a factorial-based prime detector is at least proportional to j

Lower bound:
Total work = sum(j from 1 to 2^n) of O(j)
           = O( 2^(2n) )

This is exponential time in n.
